Homework week 4

District Summary

For each calculation a new definition was created for
"Total Schools", "Total Students", "Total Budget", "Average Math Score", "Average Reading Score", "% Passing Math", "% Passing Reading", "% Overall Passing

For the overall section binning was added, though it could have been more productive being used for "% Passing Math", "% Passing Reading"

A new data frame was created with assigning certain values as "float"

School Summary

Similiar code was used while assigning a new dataframe name
